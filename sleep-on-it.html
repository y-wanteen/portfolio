          <h1> CONCEPT DEVELOPMENT</h1>
          <p>
            This application was <span class="highlight">inspired</span> by another application we found on the Google Play store that helps the <span class="highlight">user track their productivity and how long they have studied for</span>. The <span class="highlight">longer they spend studying, the larger a tree within the app grows</span>. We decided to <span class="highlight">adapt the growth concept to a sleep tracker and alarm related application where you can grow stars while you sleep</span>. We also thought that a sleep tracker might be something that students like ourselves may find useful when trying to fix our abysmal sleep schedules or see just how bad they really are. 

â€‹            <span class="spacer"></span>
  
            We decided to have <span class="highlight">three different types of alarms and timers</span> to allow users to track how long they sleep for depending on their needs. The <span class="highlight">clock</span>is used when the user has a <span class="highlight">specific time they need to wake up at</span>, while the <span class="highlight">countdown timer</span> can be used when the user wants to <span class="highlight">sleep for a set period of time</span> (eg. power nap for 30 minutes). Lastly, the <span class="highlight">stopwatch timer</span> is used when the user wants to <span class="highlight">sleep indefinitely, but keep track of how long they sleep for</span> in total. Data regarding how long the user has slept for is saved within a database and viewed through a sleeping log screen.

          <h1>PROGRAMMING</h1>
          <p> For this application, I was responsible for coding the bulk of the application's <span class="highlight">back-end features</span> while my teammates focused more on the front-end and layout. I coded the <span class="highlight">alarm clock feature and the log of sleep sessions</span>. For the back-end, I coded the <span class="highlight">storage of data from each alarm and timer into a MySQLite database</span>, as well as <span class="highlight">accessing and displaying data from the database</span>. I also <span class="highlight">compiled the other features</span> coded by my teammates into a <span class="highlight">single application</span> and added extraneous features such as <span class="highlight">notifications and sound</span>. 
          </p>

          <p> The alarm clock allows the user to <span class="highlight">set a specific time</span> that they want to sleep until. When the alarm (or other timers) <span class="highlight">goes off</span>, a <span class="highlight">notification is displayed and sound is played</span>. <span class="highlight">Tapping</span> the notification <span class="highlight">opens up the app</span> and <span class="highlight">allows the user to turn off alarm</span> while simultaneously <span class="highlight">saving the data of the sleep session</span> (eg. date, amount of time slept, growth size of the star) to the database. </p>

          <p>The <span class="highlight">log of sleep sessions</span> is a <span class="highlight">list of items</span> that each have the <span class="highlight">date and starting time of when the user went to sleep</span>. Tapping on an items opens up a new activity screen that <span class="highlight">displays all the information of the sleep session</span> (eg. date, amount of time slept, when the session started and ended) as well as a <span class="highlight">visual of the star</span> that grew while the user was sleeping.</p>

        <h1> REFLECTION </h1>
        <p> Some of the problems we ran into mainly involved the use of services to allow some of the application's features to continue running in the background even if the application is closed. After the clock, countdown timer, or stopwatch is started, the amount of time elapsed and the growth of the star in accordance to how much time passes should be able to continue being kept track of when the app is not open. Unfortunately, we were unable to make this work because the value of how much time passed was not being sent or received. </p>
         <p>Regardless, we were successful overall in making a basic application that helps keep track of how long the user has sleeps for. We were able to implement the majority of the features we planned within the given time frame, including all of the basic functionality such as the alarms and timer as well as the saving and accessing of information to and from the database. If we had more time to work on the application, I would like to work on fixing up the appearance of the sleeping log to have it match what we initially visualized.</p>
